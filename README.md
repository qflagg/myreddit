##Design Documents
The purpose of this application is to provide an easy way for users of Reddit.com (a.k.a. Redditors) to make use of the full functionalities of the Reddit site on their Android device.

Redditors will be able to log into their Reddit account and see their front-page -- all their current subscribed subreddits -- in an organized clean UI. They'll be able to easily navigate, comment, post, and message other users.
